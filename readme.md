This report provides an overview of the process to select a neural
network to classify LIDAR Fresnel zone cloud data.

## Inputs

The inputs to the neural network (NN) will be LIDAR Fresnel point
clouds. Each point cloud will have a different number of points. This
poses a problem for NNs, as they generally require an equal number of
inputs to create the NN. So, explore ways of allowing a NN to process
unequal number of inputs.

## Potential NN Architectures

In general, there are three fundamentally different classes of neural
network architectures:[@nnlm]

1.  Single-layer feedforward

    -   Simplest form of NN

    -   An input layer of source nodes projects directly onto an output
        layer of neurons.
